# biologyLabDataSorting
A set of sorting algorithms I used for the biology lab. These include a counter, and one that drops rows if they only have 1 word in the scientific name.

The code will not work just by pressing run, you must un-comment what algorithm you want to use, and which data you want to use it with.
